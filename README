Sunix will be my own modified Linux version, and all these changes base on Ubuntu.

installation:
1. add all lines which in bashrc into your ~/.bashrc 
2. copy .Sunix/ directory to your ~/	(tips: .Sunix is a hidden directory)
3. "$ xo ~/.Sunix/bin/*"	(before that you should restart your bash)

configuration:
1. edit ~/.Sunix/conf as notes.
2. edit your own shortpath in ~/.Sunix/shortpath

Features:
all commands:

//system commands
..	:	cd..
l	:	ls
la	:	ls -A
ll	:	ls -l
mk	:	make
xo	:	chmod a+u
//commands which is added with Sunix
g	:	go		# open a website in google-chrome
?	:	about	# search a string in google.com
g2	:	goto	# switching working directory quickly
cln	:	clean	# clean all the *~ files, etc.

Ps. you could execute your file just like "$ myprog" instead of "$ ./myprog"
