Sunix will be my own modified Linux version, and all these changes base on Ubuntu.

installation:
1. add lines which in bashrc into your ~/.bashrc (note: There're two modes in bashrc, please take one.
2. copy .Sunix/ directory to your ~/	(tips: .Sunix is a hidden directory)
3. "$ xo ~/.Sunix/bin/*"	(before that you should restart your bash)

Or

# this could also update Sunix currently
$ ./install.sh [-neg #for negative mode]
 
note:If you install Sunix with negative mode, you will have to active your Sunix by typint commond 'sunix' every time when you open a new shell/tab.

needed:
1. curl

configuration(if install first time):
1. edit ~/.Sunix/conf as notes.
2. edit your own shortpath in ~/.Sunix/shortpath

Features:
all commands:

//system commands
..	:	cd..
l	:	ls
la	:	ls -A
ll	:	ls -l
mk	:	make
xo	:	chmod a+u
//commands which is added with Sunix
g	:	go		# open a website in your browser
?	:	about	# search a string in google.com
g2	:	goto	# switching working directory quickly
cln	:	clean	# clean all the *~ files, etc.
trs	:	translate	# translate a english string into your langauge

Ps. you could execute your file just like "$ myprog" instead of "$ ./myprog" if you set that up.
